The README file contains the description of the following projects:

## 1. Black Friday Sales

 About Dataset:
 - Black Friday is a shopping holiday  that takes place on the day after Thanksgiving. It is known for its deep discounts and special deals on a wide range of products, including electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. Many retailers offer special doorbuster deals and extended hours on Black Friday, and it is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year. 
- The dataset that we are having contains 537578 rows and 12 columns.
- Our main goal will be to do various kind of analysis and get inferences which will be able to help to provide valuable insights on the market and hence will be beneficial for the company.
 
 We are going to divide the project into 7 parts:
   1. Dataset Walkthrough
   2. Analyzing Columns
   3. Analyzing Gender
   4. Analysing Age & Marital Status
   5. Multi Column Analysis
   6. Occupation and Products Analysis
   7. Combining Gender & Marital Status

## 2.	GDP Analysis

 About Dataset:
 - Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the size and health of an economy. It represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period of time, usually a year. GDP is considered a key indicator of a country's economic performance and is used to compare the economic output of different countries.
- There are several ways to analyze GDP data. One way is to compare GDP growth over time to get a sense of how an economy is expanding or contracting. Another way is to compare GDP per capita, which is GDP divided by the population of a country, to get a sense of the average standard of living in a country.
 - Country, regional and world GDP in current US Dollars ($). Regional means collections of countries e.g. Europe & Central Asia.
 - The data is sourced from the World Bank, which in turn lists as sources: World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.

  We are going to divide the project into 7 parts:
   1. Dataset Walkthrough
   2. GDP Growth of a Country
   3. GDP Growth of whole Dataset
   4. Plotting Graph using Plotly
   5. Plotting Graph of each Country wrt to world (80T)
   6. GDP across countries Comparison
   7. Compare GDP growth for different countries
