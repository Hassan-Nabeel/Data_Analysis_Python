The README file contains the description of the following projects:

## 1.	Walmart Analytics

 Library used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
 
 About Dataset:
  - Explore the world of retail analytics with the Walmart Supermarket Sales Prediction Dataset.
  - This dataset provides historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores, each containing multiple departments.
  - Your task is to predict department-wide sales for each store, taking into account various factors such as promotional markdowns and holiday events.
  - The dataset contains the three dataset.

 We are going to divide the project into 7 parts:
   1. Dataset Walkthrough
   2. Data Cleaning
   3. Data Merging (creating a one datafram)
   4. Visualizing weekly sales
   5. Analyzing Weekly Sales per Stores
   6. Analyzing Weekly Sales per Department
   7. Correlation

## 2.	My Uber Drives

 Library used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

 About Dataset:
 - Here are the details of my Uber Drives of 2016. I am sharing this dataset for data science community to learn from the behavior of an ordinary Uber customer.
 - Time period: January - December 2016
 - Unit of analysis: Drives
 - Total Drives: 1,155
 - Total Miles: 12,204
 - Dataset: The dataset contains Start Date, End Date, Start Location, End Location, Miles Driven and Purpose of drive (Business, Personal, Meals, Errands, Meetings, Customer Support etc.)

 We are going to divide the project into 6 parts:
   1. Dataset Walkthrough
   2. Data Cleaning
   3. Analyzing most frequent start location, stop location and frequent miles
   4. Creating a smaller datafrmes to check for outliers and round trip
   5. Visualizing cab booking frequency over a months
   6. Analyzing majority of time cabs booked

## 3. Black Friday Sales

  Library used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

 About Dataset:
 - Black Friday is a shopping holiday  that takes place on the day after Thanksgiving. It is known for its deep discounts and special deals on a wide range of products, including electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. Many retailers offer special doorbuster deals and extended hours on Black Friday, and it is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year. 
- The dataset that we are having contains 537578 rows and 12 columns.
- Our main goal will be to do various kind of analysis and get inferences which will be able to help to provide valuable insights on the market and hence will be beneficial for the company.
 
 We are going to divide the project into 7 parts:
   1. Dataset Walkthrough
   2. Analyzing Columns
   3. Analyzing Gender
   4. Analysing Age & Marital Status
   5. Multi Column Analysis
   6. Occupation and Products Analysis
   7. Combining Gender & Marital Status

## 4.	Sugarcane Production

  Library used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

  About Dataset:
  - Worldwide 1,889,268,880 tones of sugarcane is produced per year.
  - Brazil is the largest sugarcane producer in the world with 768,678,382 tones production volume per year.
  - India comes second with 348,448,000 tones yearly production.
  - Brazil and India produce together 59% of World's total.

 We are going to divide the project into 6 parts:
