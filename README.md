## 1. Black Friday Sales

 About Dataset
 - Black Friday is a shopping holiday  that takes place on the day after Thanksgiving. It is known for its deep discounts and special deals on a wide range of products, including electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. Many retailers offer special doorbuster deals and extended hours on Black Friday, and it is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year. 
- The dataset that we are having contains 537578 rows and 12 columns.
- Our main goal will be to do various kind of analysis and get inferences which will be able to help to provide valuable insights on the market and hence will be beneficial for the company.

   1. Dataset Walkthrough

   3. Analyzing Gender
   4. Analysing Age & Marital Status
